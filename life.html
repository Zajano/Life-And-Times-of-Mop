      <h1><i>Life and Origins</i></h1>
  <div id="content">
    <ul>
      <li>
        Mop came into this world on October 22, 2016 on a small farm in Arkansas. She left the farm at the early age of 4 weeks, setting off to Chicago to make a name for herself in the big city.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Despite her conservative upbringing, she found a home among the liberal populace and adopted a human whom she saw fit to accompany her on her meteoric rise to glory.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        With little effort she quickly became an internet sensation and local celbrity. Heads would turn as she walked down the street, often commenting along the lines of, "They have a cat on a leash! Why are they talking to it like that?"
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Eventually she grew weary of the burden fame brought and sought refuge in the great outdoors, hoping the remoteness would bring at least a modicum of peace in the howling storm that was her life.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Alas, her daring adventures and exploits only brought more attention to her. One such as she could not go unnoticed by the masses yearning for the same command of life she wielded.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Fortunately, Mop is as wise as she is daring and beautiful. She knew she was but still a kitty and could not burn so bright for so long without consequences.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Unlike the phoenix, she did not wish to rise from ash. As a preemptive measure Mop struck out for a new life in a new city and shed her blazing persona for a more humble cat of the house.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        And so now she sits along the crest of Seattle, biding her time until she is ready for the attention of the world once more. Watching from her perch, preferably in the sun.
      </li>
    </ul>
